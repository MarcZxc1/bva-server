# Restock Planner Presentation Script (PPT)

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Title:** "Restock Planner: AI-Powered Inventory Optimization"
**Subtitle:** "Making Smart Restocking Decisions with Data-Driven Intelligence"
**Presenter Name & Date**

**Script:**
"Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. Today I'm excited to present Restock Planner - an AI-powered tool that revolutionizes how small and medium businesses manage their inventory restocking. This tool helps sellers make data-driven decisions about what to restock and in what quantities, maximizing their return on investment."

---

## Slide 2: The Problem
**Title:** "The Challenge: Manual Restocking Decisions"
**Content:**
- Overstocking ties up capital
- Stockouts lead to missed sales
- No visibility into demand patterns
- Manual guesswork

**Script:**
"Before Restock Planner, sellers faced significant challenges. They would either overstock products, tying up valuable capital in inventory that doesn't sell, or understock and miss out on sales opportunities. Most decisions were based on gut feeling rather than data. There was no visibility into demand patterns, payday cycles, or seasonal trends."

---

## Slide 3: What is Restock Planner?
**Title:** "Restock Planner: Your AI Inventory Strategist"
**Content:**
- AI-powered restocking optimization tool
- Budget-aware recommendations
- Demand forecasting with ML algorithms
- Context-aware adjustments

**Script:**
"Restock Planner is an intelligent tool that optimizes your restocking decisions based on your budget, business goals, and AI-powered demand forecasts. It's like having a data scientist on your team, analyzing your sales history, profit margins, and market trends to tell you exactly what to restock and in what quantities."

**How it works:**
"At its core, Restock Planner uses machine learning algorithms to predict future demand. It analyzes your historical sales data, considers factors like payday cycles and holidays, and then optimizes your restocking plan to maximize either profit, volume, or a balanced approach - depending on your business goals."

---

## Slide 4: Key Features Overview
**Title:** "Powerful Features for Smart Restocking"
**Content:**
1. **Intelligent Forecasting** - ML algorithms predict demand
2. **Optimization Strategies** - Profit, Volume, or Balanced
3. **Context Integration** - Paydays, holidays, weather
4. **Budget Optimization** - Maximize ROI with your budget
5. **Forecast Calendar** - Visual demand spikes

**Script:**
"Restock Planner comes with five powerful features. First, intelligent forecasting uses multiple machine learning algorithms to predict future sales. Second, you can choose optimization strategies - maximize profit, maximize volume, or use a balanced approach. Third, the system integrates context like payday cycles and holidays that affect demand. Fourth, it optimizes your budget to maximize return on investment. And finally, a forecast calendar shows you visual demand spikes."

---

## Slide 5: Intelligent Forecasting
**Title:** "AI-Powered Demand Forecasting"
**Content:**
- Multiple ML algorithms (Linear, Exponential Smoothing, XGBoost)
- Confidence intervals for risk management
- Historical data analysis
- Pattern recognition

**Script:**
"Let's dive deeper into intelligent forecasting. Restock Planner uses three different machine learning algorithms - Linear regression for steady trends, Exponential Smoothing for seasonal patterns, and XGBoost for complex relationships. The system automatically selects the best algorithm for each product based on its sales pattern. It also provides confidence intervals, so you know the range of expected sales - helping you manage risk."

**Example:**
"For example, if a product typically sells 10 units per day, the system might predict 12 units with a confidence interval of 10-14 units. This gives you a realistic range to plan for."

---

## Slide 6: Optimization Strategies
**Title:** "Three Strategies for Different Goals"
**Content:**
1. **Profit Maximization** - Prioritizes high-margin, fast-moving items
2. **Volume Maximization** - Maximizes inventory turnover
3. **Balanced Growth** - Hybrid approach

**Script:**
"Restock Planner offers three optimization strategies, each designed for different business goals. Profit Maximization prioritizes products with high profit margins and fast sales velocity - perfect if you want to maximize your return on investment. Volume Maximization focuses on moving as many units as possible - ideal for businesses that want to increase market share. Balanced Growth is a hybrid approach that balances both profit and volume - great for growing businesses."

**When to use each:**
- "Use Profit Maximization when you have limited capital and want the best ROI."
- "Use Volume Maximization when you want to increase sales and market presence."
- "Use Balanced Growth when you're scaling your business and want steady growth."

---

## Slide 7: Context Integration
**Title:** "Context-Aware Demand Adjustments"
**Content:**
- **Payday Cycles**: +20% demand on 15th and month-end
- **Holidays**: +30-50% demand boost
- **Weather**: Seasonal adjustments
- **Special Events**: Mega sales, festivals

**Script:**
"One of the most powerful features is context integration. Restock Planner doesn't just look at historical averages - it considers real-world factors that affect demand. Payday cycles increase demand by 20% on the 15th and month-end - when people have money to spend. Holidays can boost demand by 30-50% depending on the holiday type. Weather affects seasonal items - like umbrellas during rainy season. And special events like mega sales or festivals create demand spikes."

**Real-world example:**
"For a Filipino business, the system knows that paydays on the 15th and 30th mean increased demand. It automatically adjusts forecasts and recommends restocking before these dates to avoid stockouts."

---

## Slide 8: Budget Optimization
**Title:** "Maximize ROI with Your Budget"
**Content:**
- Input your available budget
- System suggests optimal product mix
- Shows expected profit, revenue, and ROI
- Considers sales history and profit margins

**Script:**
"Budget optimization is where Restock Planner really shines. You simply input how much money you have available for restocking - say ₱10,000. The system then analyzes all your products, their profit margins, sales velocity, and demand forecasts. It creates an optimized plan that maximizes your return on investment within your budget."

**Example:**
"Let's say you have ₱10,000. The system might recommend:
- 50 units of Product A (best seller, high margin) - ₱5,000
- 30 units of Product B (trending, good margin) - ₱3,000
- 20 units of Product C (steady seller) - ₱2,000

This plan is expected to generate ₱15,000 in revenue with ₱7,500 profit - that's a 75% ROI on your investment."

---

## Slide 9: Forecast Calendar
**Title:** "Visual Demand Forecasting"
**Content:**
- Monthly calendar view
- Demand spikes highlighted
- Paydays and holidays marked
- Click for detailed forecasts
- Integration with MarketMate

**Script:**
"The Forecast Calendar provides a visual representation of expected demand. It's a monthly calendar where days with high demand are highlighted. Paydays and holidays are automatically marked. You can click on any date to see detailed forecasts for that day - which products are expected to sell more, and by how much."

**Integration:**
"The calendar also integrates with MarketMate. If you see a high-demand day coming up, you can create a marketing campaign directly from the calendar to capitalize on that demand spike."

"Using Restock Planner is incredibly simple - just four steps. First, you set your budget - how much money you have available.
